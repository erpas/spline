about=A modified cubic Hermite spline interpolator is used to obtain continuous piecewise third-degree polynomials between knots (known spline points). Each piece is converted to a chain of lines which is then simplified with Douglas-Peuker algorithm. The Processing algorithm supports vertices' z and m values - they are interpolated linearly between knots.
